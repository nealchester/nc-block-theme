# JavaScript File Documentation

The following jQuery scripts are available for use if the project needs them. `menus.js` is the only file that is registered and enqueued by default. The other scripts must be registered and enqueued. 

* **`menus.js`** makes WordPress menus accessible and easier to use on mobile devices.

# Documentation

***Note:** This theme requires the [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) plugin IF you want to utilize the included custom Gutenberg blocks.*

As a front-end developer converting design concepts to live websites, I created the NC Framework to serve as a starting point from which to build custom websites for WordPress. It can be used as a parent theme or extended with a child theme. 

The theme is coded in:

* **Modern CSS** - uses flexbox, grid, and custom properties
* **BEM CSS** - uses Block Element Modifier coding methodology
* **Semantic HTML** - modern HTML5 with support for technical SEO
* **Accessible** - supports screen readers and keyboard navigation
* **Responsive** - mobile-friendly with support for responsive images

The theme supports all of WordPress' native features and standard templates. The theme comes with basic CSS for layout and responsive purposes, but it's up to you to make the theme match your design concept.


## 10+ Custom Gutenberg blocks

Here are a few:

  * accordion
  * image gallery (w/ lightbox)
  * hero (w/ parallax)
